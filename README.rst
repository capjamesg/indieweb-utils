Dependencies
--------------

This project uses the following dependencies:

- BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing
- mf2py for microformats parsing
- requests for making HTTP requests


Running Tests
---------------

Quality is maintained ensuring each merged passes testing, typing, linting, and formatting requirements.

To check locally install the development dependencies and run the suite using `tox`.

::

  $ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
  $ tox

Alternatively, you can run just a single check by passing the environment to tox.

Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tests use pytest.

::

  $ tox -e py39  # Run all tests
  $ tox -e py39 tests/test_indieweb_utils.py::TestPostTypeDiscovery  # Run a single test

Linting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linting is checked with black, isort, and flake8.

::

  $ tox -e lint

Black and isort errors can be fixed automatically. Use the `fmt` to fix those errors automatically.

::

  $ tox -e fmt

Typing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Types are validated with mypy.

::

  $ tox -e typecheck

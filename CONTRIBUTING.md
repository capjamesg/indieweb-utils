# Contributing to IndieWeb Utils

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the IndieWeb Utils library!

We actively welcome contributors to help us improve the library, including people who are new to open source software.

## How to Contribute

There are a few ways to contribute to IndieWeb Utils. These are:

1. Add a feature to the library (see requirements below).
2. Submit a bug fix for an existing feature.
3. Help improve our documentation by adding more examples or clarifying the existing ones.
4. Submit a feature request.
5. Help us improve our test suite.

### Adding Features

The broad goal of IndieWeb Utils is to provide simple building blocks to those who are building indie web apps. Any feature request you have in mind should aim to improve on existing building blocks or add those that you believe have multiple potential use cases.

Before you submit a pull request (PR) that adds a feature to the library, please create an Issue with a feature request.

This gives all contributors an opportunity to weigh in on your idea. This process may help facilitate more ideas. Further, submitting a feature request before any code changes are made increases the chance that your idea will be implemented in the library.

## How to Make a Change

Whether you want to improve documentation, submit a bug fix, or add to the library, you'll first need to get our repo set up on your local machine.

First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This fork is where you will push your code changes.

Next, you'll need to download and configure the project on your local machine. You can do this by following the instructions in our [README](README.md) file. The README outlines how to install the library and run test cases.

Please create a new branch for your changes by using the `git checkout -b <branch-name>` command.

Once you have made a change, please run all test cases according to the instructions in the [README](README.md) file. This helps us assure the quality of the code submitted to the library.

When you are ready to submit a change, commit your changes to the branch. Then, submit a pull request to this repository.

A contributor will review your request and either approve it or provide feedback and proposed changes.

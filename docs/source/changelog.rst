Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on `Keep a
Changelog <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`__, and this project
adheres to `Semantic
Versioning <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`__.

[0.5.0] - 2022-10-13
--------------------

Added
~~~~~

-  ``get_reply_context`` now performs discovery on ``property`` and
   ``name`` values for og:image, twitter:image:src, description,
   og:description, and twitter:description tags.

Tests
~~~~~

-  Added new tests for the ``get_reply_context`` function.
-  Added ``responses.activate`` decorators to remaining tests that did
   not already have this decorator present. This ensures all tests run
   on the contents of local files rather than making network requests to
   get data from a page.

Fixed
~~~~~

-  ``get_reply_context`` would use a h-entry even if the h-entry only
   provided a URL and no other content.
-  ``indieweb_utils.SCOPE_DEFINITIONS`` can now be imported into a
   project. This previously returned an ``ImportError`` exception.

[0.4.0] - 2022-10-11
--------------------

.. _added-1:

Added
~~~~~

Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Documentation for the ``discover_endpoints`` function.
-  The ``indieauth_callback_handler`` function returns the JSON response
   from an IndieAuth endpoint represented as a dictionary instead of a
   blank dictionary.
-  The ``discover_endpoints`` docstring contains an example about
   Microsub and an updated common values list. This is because we
   recommend use of the ``discover_webmention_endpoint`` function for
   Webmention endpoint discovery.

Functions
^^^^^^^^^

-  ``get_reply_urls`` to retrieve all of the URLs to which a specified
   page is replying.
-  ``get_page_name`` to find the name of a page per the IndieWeb `Page
   Name Discovery <https://indieweb.org/page-name-discovery>`__
   algorithm.
-  ``get_syndicated_copies`` to retrieve all of the URLs to which a
   specified page has been syndicated.

.. _tests-1:

Tests
^^^^^

-  Added test cases for:

   -  ``get_reply_urls``
   -  ``get_page_name``
   -  ``get_syndicated_copies``

-  Updated test cases for ``get_reply_context`` were to look for
   ``description`` values where appropriate.

.. _fixed-1:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  The ``indieauth_callback_handler`` function no longer raises a JSON
   error during the ``_validate_indieauth_response`` function call.
-  The ``get_reply_context`` function now returns a description based on
   the first two sentences of the e-content of a specified page if a
   summary cannot be found when analysing a h-entry.
-  The ``get_reply_context`` function returns a string ``summary`` value
   instead of a dictionary or a list.
-  ``get_reply_context`` now looks at ``og:description`` and
   ``twitter:description`` meta tags for a description if a
   ``description`` value cannot be found. This happens when analysing a
   page that does not contain a h-entry.

.. _section-2:

[0.3.1] - 2022-10-10
--------------------

Fixed import issue in ``setup.cfg`` so PyPi can discover the README for
indieweb-utils.

.. toctree::

Installation
------------------------

To install this package, run the following command:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install indieweb-utils

You can import the package using the following line of code:

.. code-block:: python

    import indieweb_utils


Custom Properties
------------------------

The structure of the custom properties tuple is:

.. code-block:: python

   (attribute_to_look_for, value_to_return)

An example custom property value is:

.. code-block:: python

    custom_properties = [
        ("poke-of", "poke")
    ]

This function would look for a poke-of attribute on a web page and return the "poke" value.

By default, this function contains all of the attributes in the Post Type Discovery mechanism.

Custom properties are added to the end of the post type discovery list, just before the "article" property. All specification property types are checked before your custom attribute.


Canonicalize a URL
------------------------

Canonicalization turns a relative URL into a complete URL.

To canonicalize a URL, use this function:

.. autofunction:: indieweb_utils.canonicalize_url

This function returns a URL with a protocol, host, and path.

The domain of the resource is needed so that it can be added to the URL during canonicalization if the URL is relative.

A complete URL returned by this function looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    https://indieweb.org/POSSE


Generate Reply Context
------------------------

To generate reply context for a given page, use the following function:

.. autofunction:: indieweb_utils.get_reply_context

This function returns a ReplyContext object that looks like this:

.. autoclass:: indieweb_utils.ReplyContext
